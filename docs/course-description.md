# Course Description

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of **embedded systems programming** using the **PIC24FJ64GA002** microcontroller. Through a combination of low-level assembly, C programming, and hands-on interaction with hardware peripherals, students gain practical experience designing, coding, and debugging microcontroller-based systems.

The course emphasizes not only syntax and structure, but also the **real-world applications** of embedded programming â€” such as controlling timers, handling interrupts, reading sensors, and sending data over serial interfaces.

## Topics Covered

- Microcontroller architecture and memory mapping
- Writing and debugging PIC24 assembly code
- Branching, loops, and conditional execution
- Stack behavior, subroutines, and frame pointers
- Timers, periodic interrupts, and real-time control
- External interrupts and input capture modules
- Output compare and pulse-width modulation (PWM)
- Communication protocols: UART, SPI, I2C
- Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Understand and manipulate hardware-level control flow
- Interface with peripherals such as buttons, LEDs, and sensors
- Configure and use timers, interrupts, and communication modules
- Translate datasheet specifications into working embedded code
- Build efficient, deterministic programs suitable for resource-constrained devices

## Tools & Environment

Students will use the following tools:

- MPLAB X IDE and XC16 compiler
- PIC24FJ64GA002 development board
- Microchip datasheets and technical documentation
- This intelligent, interactive textbook with embedded quizzes and simulations
