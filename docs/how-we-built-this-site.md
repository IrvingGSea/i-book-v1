# How We Built This Site

This intelligent textbook was built using the following tools and technologies:

- **MkDocs** — A static site generator for building project documentation.
- **MkDocs Material Theme** — Provided the styling, tabs, sidebars, and callout boxes.
- **Python** — Used to manage the environment and install necessary MkDocs plugins.
- **GitHub** — Hosted the Markdown files, source code, and configuration.
- **GitHub Pages** — Served the final static website from the `gh-pages` branch.
- **VS Code** — Used for writing, editing, and live previewing Markdown files.
- **Custom MicroSimulations** — Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and p5.js or vis.js where applicable.
- **AI Collaboration** — Some educational content was assisted through LLMs such as ChatGPT.

The project was inspired by modern open educational resources and intelligent textbooks that combine traditional material with interactive simulations and quizzes.

A large portion of this is inspired by the work of Dan McCreary. His guide in building this was instrumental.
