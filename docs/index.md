# Introduction to Microcontrollers with the PIC24

![](./assets/images/mcu-block-diagram.png)

Welcome! This intelligent textbook is designed to guide you through a collegiate-level course in **embedded systems programming** using the **PIC24FJ64GA002** microcontroller.

Throughout the chapters, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience with:

- PIC24 architecture and assembly language
- Timers, interrupts, and peripheral control
- Serial communication (UART, SPI, I2C)
- Real-time interaction using input/output hardware
- Embedded C and low-level programming techniques

Many of the features on this site include AI-generated content and interactive components such as:

- Prompt-based exercises
- Knowledge check quizzes
- Microcontroller simulations (MicroSims)

This textbook is built using `MkDocs` and the `Material for MkDocs` theme, with content version-controlled and deployed using GitHub Pages.
