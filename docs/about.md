# About This Textbook

This intelligent textbook was created to provide students with a hands-on, interactive introduction to **embedded systems programming** using the **PIC24FJ64GA002** microcontroller by Microchip.

The book blends traditional explanations with modern tools like **Markdown**, **interactive prompts**, and **MicroSims** to reinforce deep learning and experimentation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this textbook, learners should be able to:

- Understand the architecture of the PIC24FJ64GA002 microcontroller
- Write and debug assembly code for core operations (branching, loops, stack management)
- Use timers, interrupts, and peripheral modules (UART, SPI, I2C, ADC)
- Read datasheets and configure registers for real-time control
- Translate embedded concepts into working C/assembly implementations

---

## Intended Audience

This resource is designed for:

- Undergraduate students in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Embedded Systems
- Makers, hobbyists, and developers interested in microcontrollers
- Anyone learning real-time programming with resource-constrained devices

---

## Approach

The structure of this book mirrors a lab-based embedded systems course. Each chapter builds incrementally:

- **Assembly concepts and syntax** →  
- **Control structures and memory** →  
- **Peripherals, interrupts, and real-world interfacing**

Interactive elements such as **quizzes**, **prompt challenges**, and **simulations** are embedded to reinforce key ideas.
