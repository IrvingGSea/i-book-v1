# Stack Tray Simulation

This simulation uses a **cafeteria tray analogy** to demonstrate how the **call stack** behaves in a typical program.

**Features:**

- **CALL** pushes a tray onto the stack (like a function call)
- **RETURN** pops a tray off the stack (like returning from a function)
- **RESET** clears the stack entirely
- Stack grows from bottom to top (LIFO: Last In, First Out)

Each tray represents a function call, helping you visually understand how nested function calls and returns interact with memory.
