# Chapter 8 MicroSim: Serial Communication Overview

This simulation provides a quick interactive overview of three important serial communication protocols used with microcontrollers:

- **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)**
- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**
- **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)**

## ðŸ“š What You Can Do:

- Click the **UART**, **SPI**, or **I2C** tabs
- See basic visual representations of how data flows
- Understand key concepts like clocking, addressing, and handshaking
- Compare the differences between asynchronous and synchronous protocols

---

**This is a great way to visually grasp the big picture of serial communications!**
