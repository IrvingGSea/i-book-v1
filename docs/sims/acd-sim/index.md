# ADC Sampling Simulator

This MicroSim demonstrates how an **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** samples and quantizes a continuous analog signal.

- Adjust the **sampling rate** to control how often samples are taken
- Adjust the **resolution** (number of bits) to see how quantization affects the signal
- Observe how a higher sampling rate and resolution produce a smoother digital representation
